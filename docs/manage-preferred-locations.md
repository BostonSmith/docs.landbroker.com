We recommend adding all Districts within a County to your Preferred Locations table. Adding all Districts for a County will ensure you see all documents and Parcels for that County because it could have the incorrect District. For example, let's assume that Parcel No. 01-B36B-0016-0000 is located in Buffalo District, Brooke County, OH, but incorrectly tagged to Cross Creek District, Brooke County, OH. If your Preferred Locations Table only has Cross Creek District, Brooke County, OH, you will never see this Parcel or its related documents when you search for Parcel No. 01-B36B-0016-0000. It's essential to keep in mind that Parcel Numbers are unique at the County level, which is why we made this recommendation.
